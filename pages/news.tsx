						<h1>2024 is Here</h1>
						<p>
							Hello everyone. As time marches forwards and the
							calendar turns over to a new year I would like to
							say thanks. To everyone who, living in an era of
							unrestricted access to infinite entertainment,
							decided to spend their time here.
							<br />
							<br />
							Trivial and low-stakes as it may be, creating and
							maintaining a space where a community like this can
							develop brings me great joy.
							<br />
							<br />
							May 2024 be good and prosperous for you all.
						</p>

						<h1>Donations & More</h1>
						<p>
							Hello everyone, today we're happy to announce, among
							other things, that you can now support Prosperity
							with a monthly or one-time donation and help us stay
							online for years to come. For now the main benefit
							is simply supporting the server, however we are open
							to suggestions for more we could do. See the
							donations page
							<br />
							<br />
							<h3>Re imagined Website</h3>
							<br />
							Along with this announcement I'm also pleased to
							release the newly redesigned and rewritten website.
							I've been working late into the night on this over
							the past week and I think it befits beautiful builds
							it showcases. Check it out
							<br />
							<br />
							<h3>Next Server Game Night</h3>

							We would also like to let everyone know that the
							next community game night will occur, starting on,
